1)
->Multithreading is a process to achieve multitasking.To execute two or more threads at a time in a single program is called multithreading.It is important because i modern world we want to do multiple works at a time to achieve this we can use multithreading.
->To reduce the running time if a program we use multithreading.

2)
->Using multiThreading we can allocate the timing of execution effieciently.
->It improves performance.
->It saves time.

3)
->Thread actually means a line of execution in java. 
->Threads are light weight processes.
->Thread schedular will schedule which thread has to be executed first.

4)
Two ways of implementing thread in java:
----------------------------------------
->By extending the Thread class
->By implementing the runnable interface

5)
Thread: It is a light weight process,it has the ability to execute different parts of  
	the program at a time.
Process: Process is the program under action.Aprocess can be handled by process control 	 block.

6)
->Daemon threads are actually the low priority threads.
->we can create daemon threads using thread class setDaemon(true).
->thread.isDaemon() method returns true if the thread is a daemon thread.

7)
->wait is non-static method that causes thread to wait and sleep until somethread calls notifyAll() or notify().
->sleep() method will execute after waiting some period of time no need to call explicitly like wait()method.
