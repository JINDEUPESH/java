DAY 1 - 08/05/2023

1)write a program that takes 3 integers as input from the users finds their sum and average and finally displays sum and average as a floating point number with 2 decimal places.
	//using string.format("%.2f",avg) we can get average value upto 2 decimal places
	//using printf statement and %.2f in the double quotes can get floating value upto 2 decimal places
2)write a program that takes any integer as input and tells if the integer is even or odd using conditional operator
	//use if condition
	//using ternery operator string b = (a%2==0)?(even):(odd),to print a string declare the variable as string.
3)write a program that takes an year as input and displays if the year is a leap year
	//testcases:1)input:1998 -expected output:not a leap year
			2)input:2000 -expected output: a leap year
			3)input:1900 -expected output:not  a leap year
	//HINT:should be divisible by 4 and 400 and should not be divisible by 100.
		 A leap year is exactly divisible by 4 except for century years (years ending with 00). The century year is a leap year only if 		 
		 it is perfectly divisible by 400. For example, 1999 is not a leap year.
4)write a program that takes inputs from the user continuosly until zero is entered and prints count and sum of all the numbers entered by the users

DAY 2 - 09/05/2023

-> we can call a method without using object or instance by using static keyword before the method name.
// static void method()
-> To reverse a string we must use  string buffer.
/*
StringBuffer s=new StringBuffer(str);
  s.reverse();
*/
->s.reverse() is not considered as string,so to store it in the string we must convert into the string.
//String b(new variable to store reversed string)=buffer obj.toString()
->Now we compare both the string and reversed string are equal are not using EQUALS().
// str.equals(b), it returns 0 if both are equal.

DAY 3 - 10/05/2023

5)write a program to take an integer array as input and finds the largest elements in the array
6)write a program that takes an integer as input which is called the target sum and finds and prints all the sub arrays in the given array      	as input that sum upto the given target sum.
7)write a program given an array as input and find the peek integer as input.a peak integer is the one which is greater than the 	neighbouring numbers

-> In ELSE-IF LADDER,it comes out when one condition  satisfies.so,to check each and every condition we use simple if. 
MUTABLE OBJECT   - which can be able to change
IMMUTABLE OBJECT - which cannot be able to change
E.G:-String class
-> when a change is occured in string,it doesn't change the string simply it creates a new object and stores it in the other storage area.And the old value turns into garbage value.So,it wastes lot of storage.
-> TO overcome this issue we use STRING BUFFER CLASS.
-> If we use BUFFER CLASS the IMMUTABLE STRING converts into the MUTABLE STRING.
-> INT,DOUBLE etc other objects are turned into IMMUTABLE OBJECT by providing FINAL key word.
//compareTo is used to check the string lexicographically.
 //compareTo is used to compare 2 strings lexicographically

8)write a program that takes string as input from the user and deletes all the vowels from the strings
9)write a program that takes input from the user and splits the string wherever it finds a white space
10)write a program that takes a string as input from user and prints all the characters in a sorted manner
11)write a program that takes  a set of words and sorts them lexicographically


DAY 4 - 11/05/2023

1. Create a class named 'Rectangle' with two data members 'length' and 'breadth' and two methods to print the area and perimeter of the rectangle respectively. Its constructor having parameters for length and breadth is used to initialize length and breadth of the rectangle. Let class 'Square' inherit the 'Rectangle' class with its constructor having a parameter for its side (suppose s) calling the constructor of its parent class as 'super(s,s)'. Print the area and perimeter of a rectangle and a square.

2. Now repeat the above example to print the area of 10 squares.
Hint-Use array of objects

3. Create a class named 'Shape' with a method to print "This is This is shape". Then create two other classes named 'Rectangle', 'Circle' inheriting the Shape class, both having a method to print "This is rectangular shape" and "This is circular shape" respectively. Create a subclass 'Square' of 'Rectangle' having a method to print "Square is a rectangle". Now call the method of 'Shape' and 'Rectangle' class by the object of 'Square' class.
