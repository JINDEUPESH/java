1.There are several ways in java create an object.We can create an object using new keyword.
	Example:
		palindrome p = new palindrome();
		
		here palindrome is class name,p is object name.
	-> using new instance we can create an object.

2.The new keyword is used to create an instance of an object.It allocates memory to an    object.

3. Static variables,instance variables ,local variables.

4.Intance variable:
	->it can be accessed through out the class.
	->they are defined in class but outside the body of method
  Local variable:
	->it can be accessed within the method where it is declared.
	->they are defined with in the body of the method.

5.Instance varaibles are nothing but objects ,objects are stored in heap.
  Local variables are allocated in the stack

6.Method overloading means having same method name but different in parameters or return type of the method.Overloading is used to make the code more readable and reusable.
	example:

	class calc
	{
	    int add(int a,int b)
	    {
	        return a+b;
	    }
	    int add(int a,int b,int c)
	    {
	        return a+b+c;
	    }
	}
	public class methodOverloading 
	{
	    public static void main(String[] args) 
   	    {
        	calc obj = new calc();
 	        int result = obj.add(10,20);
 	        System.out.println(result);
 	    }    

	}
