1)
->Aquiring the properties and behaviours from Parent class to child classes is known as Inheritance.
->It maintains "IS A" kind of relationship.
->In java we can achieve inheritance using extends keyword.

2)
->Superclass is a parent class.A class which is parent of subclass.
->subclass is a child class.A class that inherits the properties and behaviours of parent class. 

3)
->Inheritance is implemented using the extends keyword in java.
->to implement interface inheritance we use implements keyword .

4)
->polymorphism means manyforms.
->they are two types of plymorphism compile time and run time.
	1.compile time polymorphism is method overloading.
	2.run time polymorphism is method overriding.

5)
Method overLoading:
-------------------
->Having same method name but different in parameters or same parameters but different in return type of method is known as method overloading.
->compile time polymorphism is known as method overloading.
->It will happen in same class.

Method overRiding:
------------------
->It will have same name and parameters but different classes.
->Run time polymorphism is known as method overriding.
->It will happen in different classes.

6)
->Hiding the internal details and showing only the functionality to the user is known as abstraction.
example: Abstract class Upesh
	{
		abstract method handsome()
		{
			//body
		}
	}

7)
->The differwence between abstract and final method is that we cannot override a final method but we can override a abstract method. 
->Abstract method is incomplete and final method is complete.

8)
->A class declared with final keyword is known as final class.
->we cannot inherit the final class in java.
->if we try to inherit the final class compiler will throw an compile time error.

9)
Abstraction:
------------
->Hiding the internal details and showing the functionality is known as abstraction in java.
->It can be implemeted through abstract classes and methods.

Encapsulation:
--------------
->Binding the data and methods of a class together is known as encapsulation in java.
->It can be implemented using access modifiers like public,private,default,protected.
->we use getters and setters to hide the data. 

10)
CompileTime Polymorphism:
-------------------------
->method overloading is known as compile time polymorphism.
->Inheritance is not involved.
->Having same method name but different in parameters or same parameters but different in return type of method is known as method overloading.

RunTime Polymorphism:
---------------------
->method overriding is known as run time polymorphism.
->Inheritance is involved.
->It will have same name and parameters but different classes.
